function safe = safePosition(pos)
%SAFEPOSITION Figure position that minimizes clipping on screen.
%
% Given a 4-element position vector P, SAFEPOSITION measures the screensize
% and the new figure size to shift the figure left or down to fit on
% screen. This is needed for modal figures, whose titlebar (and the close
% button) may drift out of reach.
%
% Example:
%   SAFEPOSITION([5000 500 400 600]) returns [1515 500 400 600].
%
% Safe values will differ when run on different monitor configurations.

%{
% EG:
% Below is an attempt to improve safePosition for multiple monitors.
% The idea is to guess on what screen we are by looking at which screen
% contains most of the figure.
% The problem is the function is only controlling that the figure isn't
% leaking out of screen on the right side... so I'm demoting it because
% it seems pretty useless anyway.
